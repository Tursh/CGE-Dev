# Cross Game Engine (CGE)

This a primitive game engine made with OpenGL

##Documentation
If you want to checkout the documentation simply install doxygen on you operating system

###Linux
Get to your directory containing CGE and type 'doxygen' in your terminal.
Then it should generate the documentation inside the doc/ directory. 
To access simply open the index.html in you browser. 

###Windows
You can get the binaries from https://www.doxygen.nl/
But for now I don't have any windows compatibility so I don't know why you want these on windows...
